# Preface

This book is meant to teach people how to take any *LFS system and turn it into a LiveCD from scratch. I wrote this book to get the knowledge of how to do modern LiveCDs (with UEFI + BIOS boot, stateless boot, and installers) out of ancient forum posts and bash scripts. You can follow this after any iteration of the LFS book, but throughout packages will be recommended.
