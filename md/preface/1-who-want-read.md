# Who Would Want to Read this Book 

Anyone who wants to learn how a LiveCD works and want to build one to bring their LFS install anywhere!

This book is mainly aimed at *LFS systems but may be applicable to any modern Linux system with some modifications (init-agnostic). With this book you can create everything from a hardened enviornment to a commerical distro installer.

This book is currently not versioned but should work with any Linux OS from ~2010 onward. This book is not related to the now defunct LFS Prebuilt LiveCD
